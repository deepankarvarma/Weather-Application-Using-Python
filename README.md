# Weather Application Using Python

This repository contains code for analyzing the weather conditions of a location using the OpenWeatherMap API. The application retrieves current weather data and displays it in a tabular format. It also provides a graphical representation of the 24-hour weather forecast for the specified location.

## Features

- Retrieves and displays the current weather conditions for a given city.
- Shows the description, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- Retrieves and displays a 24-hour weather forecast for the specified location.
- Tabulates the forecast data, including the timestamp and temperature.
- Plots a graph of the temperature variation over the next 24 hours.

## Usage

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap by signing up on their website.
3. Set your API key as an environment variable or directly in the code (`API_KEY = '<your-api-key>'`).
